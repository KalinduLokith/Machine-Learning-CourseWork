In this coursework, I will focus on performing sentiment analysis on social media data. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet or a Facebook post. The objective of this coursework is to develop a system that can automatically classify social media posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

Dataset Description:
A dataset of social media posts will be provided, which includes a large number of posts from various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The dataset contains text data along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

Objectives/Deliverables:

    1.Data Preprocessing:

        Perform text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization on the social media posts.
        Handle any missing or noisy data in the dataset.

    2.Feature Extraction:

        Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data. This can include bag-of-words representations, TF-IDF vectors, or word embeddings.
        Explore different feature representation techniques and justify the choice of the selected method.
    
   3.Model Selection and Training:

        Select and implement appropriate machine learning or deep learning models for sentiment analysis, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Recurrent Neural Networks.
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
        Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

  4.Model Evaluation and Comparison:

        Compare the performance of different models and identify the most effective model for sentiment analysis on social media data.
        Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model and provide insights into their performance.
  
  5.Fine-tuning and Optimization:

        Perform hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques to further improve the performance of the selected model.
        Explore different optimization methods (e.g., grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization) and discuss the impact on model performance.
    
  6.Visualization and Interpretation:

      Visualize the results of sentiment analysis, such as the distribution of sentiments in the dataset and the performance of the selected model.
      Interpret the results and provide insights into the sentiment trends in social media data.
  
  7.Discussion and Conclusion:

      Summarize the findings of the coursework and discuss the challenges and limitations of sentiment analysis on social media data.
      Propose possible future enhancements or extensions to the sentiment analysis system.
